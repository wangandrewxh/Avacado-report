Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices

**Reason + Relevance:** <br>
I decided to pick a dataset from the Business-related category, and wanted to analyse something interesting, which is why I picked Avocado prices + sales. This dataset only has data available from people in the USA from the years 2015 to 2018. Nevertheless, I feel that it is quite relevant to US citizens who really love eating avocados and may want to visualise the sales and price of avocados. There is also potential for these individuals to pick the best time to buy avocados, in what region, and what variety. 

**Key Insights:**<br>
•	In total there were 15.52 billion individual avocados and 4.37 billion bags of avocados that were sold over the time period of 2015 to 2018 in USA, with the average price of a single avocado being $1.41 USD. <br>
•	The most popular variety of avocados are the PLU 4046, the most popular bag sold is the small bag, and conventional avocados are by far the more popular type of avocado, containing 97.19% of all sales compared to conventional avocados only having 2.81%. <br>
•	There was an increasing trend of avocado sales over time; however, for some reason sales seemed to fall dramatically in the year of 2018. <br>
•	Avocados were most expensive at $1.52 in 2017, and cheapest at $1.34 in 2016<br>
•	Out of all the regions in the USA, the most avocados are sold in California<br>
